# Cluster

 [Cluster](http://learnboost.github.com/cluster) is an extensible multi-core server manager for [node.js](http://nodejs.org).

## Installation

```bash
$ npm install cluster
```

## Features

  - zero-downtime restart
  - hard shutdown support
  - graceful shutdown support
  - resuscitates workers
  - maintains worker count, even if worker was _SIGKILL_ed.
  - workers commit suicide when master dies 
  - spawns one worker per cpu (by default)
  - extensible via plugins
  - bundled plugins
    - [cli](http://learnboost.github.com/cluster/docs/cli.html): provides a command-line interface for your cluster
    - [debug](http://learnboost.github.com/cluster/docs/debug.html): verbose debugging information
    - [logger](http://learnboost.github.com/cluster/docs/logger.html): master / worker logs
    - [pidfiles](http://learnboost.github.com/cluster/docs/pidfiles.html): writes master / worker pidfiles
    - [reload](http://learnboost.github.com/cluster/docs/reload.html): reloads workers when files change
    - [repl](http://learnboost.github.com/cluster/docs/repl.html): perform real-time administration
    - [stats](http://learnboost.github.com/cluster/docs/stats.html): adds real-time statistics to the `repl` plugin
  - supports node 0.2.x
  - supports node 0.4.x
  - supports TCP servers

## Example

app.js:

```javascript
var http = require('http');

module.exports = http.createServer(function(req, res){
  console.log('%s %s', req.method, req.url);
  var body = 'Hello World';
  res.writeHead(200, { 'Content-Length': body.length });
  res.end(body);
});
```

server.js:

```javascript
var cluster = require('cluster')
  , app = require('./app');

cluster(app)
  .use(cluster.logger('logs'))
  .use(cluster.stats())
  .use(cluster.pidfiles('pids'))
  .use(cluster.cli())
  .use(cluster.repl(8888))
  .listen(3000);
```

Note that cluster does _not_ create these directories for you, so you may want to:

    $ mkdir {logs,pids}

recommended usage: passing the path to prevent unnecessary database connections in the master process, as `./app` is only `require()`ed within the workers.

```javascript
var cluster = require('cluster');

cluster('./app')
  .use(cluster.logger('logs'))
  .use(cluster.stats())
  .use(cluster.pidfiles('pids'))
  .use(cluster.cli())
  .use(cluster.repl(8888))
  .listen(3000);
```
